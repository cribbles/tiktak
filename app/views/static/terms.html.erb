<%= Settings.site_name %> is provided as a free service for <%= Settings.campus_name %> students, by <%= Settings.campus_name %>
students. Unlike many Internet forums, <%= Settings.site_name %> is completely anonymous and
almost completely unmoderated. In order to ensure that this site remains a
safe, healthy, viable channel of discourse for the <%= Settings.campus_name %> community, we
ask that you follow a few rules. By using any service provided by this
website, you agree to respect and abide by these rules. These are:
<br />
<br />
<b>1. No name-checking or harassment.</b> This means: do not defame, insult, or
personally attack a current or recent <%= Settings.campus_name %> student. Likewise, do not
infringe upon the privacy of a current or recent <%= Settings.campus_name %> student. It's okay to
speak unfavorably of a public performance, work or art, or body of work
undertaken by a student, as long as you don't branch off into attacking that
student on the basis of hir character. It's okay to speak unfavorably of an
institution (such as a fraternity, a student group, or a branch of student
government), but don't single out individuals. Do not try to circumvent this
rule by dropping hints about somebody's identity without actually saying who
they are. If you're unsure whether your post qualifies as name-checking or
harassment, don't post it.
<br />
<br />
Name threads (e.g. "Jane Smith: straight, single?", "Who are the hottest
freshmen?") are almost universally a bad idea, even when they are intended
to be positive.  Please do not post them, as they will be removed.
<br />
<br />
<b>2. No robots or spam.</b> This means no viagra, free iPods, or ch3ap c0ach
h4ndb4gs; it also means no automated crawling of our servers. If you're a
student and you'd like to promote your performance or show, no matter how
shamelessly, go ahead.
<br />
<br />
3. Do not post or request anything that violates United States law.
<br />
<br />
4. <%= Settings.site_name %> is not intended for visitors under 18 years of age. Accordingly, you
may not view or contribute to this forum if you are under 18 years old.
<br />
<br />
Posts are liable to be removed at any time and for any
reason; this forum is moderated according to the spirit of the law, not the
letter.
<br />
<br />
If you'd like a post to be removed, click the "Report" link
followed by the "Report This Message" button on the subsequent page to have it
sent to a queue for moderation. You don't have to be logged in to report posts.
